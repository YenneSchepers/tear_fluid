#Tear Fluid Extraction Experiment
We took samples of tear fluid from 12 people via a strip that was cut into a short and long piece afterwards. 16 samples (8 short strips and 8 long strips) were put on ice and the other 6 samples were snap frozen with liquid nitrogen. From the 16 samples on ice, we extracted the RNA and performed a TapeStation on the extracted RNA samples.
## Data
Data obtained was put into an Excel file and uploaded into RStudio to calculate the molecular weight of the RNA of the short and long pieces and to make a boxplot of the molecular weight vs if the sample was a long or short piece. 
## Goal
If we cut the strip of tear fluid into a short and long piece, the top part of the strip (the part that was closest to the eye) will contain cellular RNA and the bottom part will only contain extracellular RNA.
